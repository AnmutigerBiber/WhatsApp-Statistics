# WhatsApp Statistics
 
This is a little tool to visualize the message frequency in a WhatsApp chat.

# Usage
In WhatsApp, there is an option "export chat". This exports the chosen chat as a .zip file. You need to unpack it and give this program the `_chat.txt` as an argument. You also have to specify a target file, where the result is saved. If this file already exists, it will be overwritten, so be carefull.
